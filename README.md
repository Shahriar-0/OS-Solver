# OS-Solver

just a simple code for running LLM on 'Operating System Concepts' for better performance and understanding. simply run the codes and then using this structure to get the answer.

```python
query = "your question"
index.query(query)
```

**Note:** it uses your open-ai api key, so you need to set it up first, and indexing may take a while.

codes and implementations are inspired by *Matthew Berman*.
